# About Quantify-core

![Quantify logo](/images/QUANTIFY_LANDSCAPE.svg)

Quantify is a Python-based data acquisition framework focused on Quantum Computing and
solid-state physics experiments.
The framework consists of [quantify-core](https://pypi.org/project/quantify-core/) ([git repo](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core/))
and [quantify-scheduler](https://pypi.org/project/quantify-scheduler/) ([git repo](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler/)).
It is built on top of [QCoDeS](https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/)
and is a spiritual successor of [PycQED](https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/PycQED_py3).

`quantify-core` is the core module that contains all basic functionality to control experiments. This includes:

- A framework to control instruments.
- A data-acquisition loop.
- Data storage and analysis.
- Parameter monitoring and live visualization of experiments.
